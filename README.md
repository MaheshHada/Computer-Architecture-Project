# Computer-Architecture-Project
Completed for the COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE COURSE CS F342 PROJECT
A VLIW architecture with two parralel five staged pipelines was designed with given instruction set and simulated on Xilinx, 
The repository contains the verilog code for the architecture as VLIWDesign.v
A 4-way set associative, way predictive cache with write buffer and random replacement policy was designed and simulated on Xilinx.
